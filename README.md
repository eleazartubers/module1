# Functions-Errors
ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course Module 1: Functions and Errors - The smart contract program utilizes the assert and revert functions, as well as the require statements.

# Description
The Smart Contract is made to handle a single value on Ethereum. This code demonstrates a error handling practices using different statements to protect data and avoid errors. This also handles one value securely by using require, assert, and revert statements, ensuring it's reliabilty. This contract provides useful lessons in building safe and reliable smart contracts for decentralized transactions within Web3.

# Program Execution
The initial requirement to run this program is by using Remix Ethereum IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/), and create a new file that utilizes solidity (".sol") as its programming language.

The program demonstrates the usage of require to validate input conditions, assert to verify assumptions, and revert to revert transactions with custom error messages. Through Remix Ethereum IDE, you can conduct testing with these functions and gain insights into their behavior. To test the contract, interact with the setValue function using different input values to see how the require function validates conditions. Also, try calling the assertValue and revertValue functions with various inputs to understand how assert verifies assumptions and revert handles transactions with custom error messages. Through these interactions, you can explore the functionality of the require, assert, and revert functions in the contract.
